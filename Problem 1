Problem 1

Description
Write a program, which calculates how long it will take you to watch all episodes of a series in minutes.

You will receive count seasons, count episodes per season and duration of each episode.

In every episode there are advertisements, whose duration is 20% of the episode’s duration.

You also have to keep in mind that every season ends with a special episode, which lasts 10 minutes longer than usual.

Input
From the console you receive 4 lines:

Name of the series - String

Count seasons – int in the range [1… 10]

Count episodes – int in the range [10… 80]

Duration of a usual episode without the advertisements – double in the range [40.0… 65.0]

Output
You have to print on the console the time needed to watch all of the episodes, rounded down to the nearest whole number in the following format:

"Total time needed to watch the {name of the series} series is {time} minutes."

print(f'Total time needed to watch the {name_series} series is {math.floor(total_time)} minutes.')
