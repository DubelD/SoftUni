Problem 5

Description
You are hired by a TV company to write a program that calculate whether it is possible for customers to purchase the desired series.

You have a budget and number of series that the user will want to purchase.

Each series has a title and price.

Some of the series have a discount:

Thrones – 50%

Lucifer – 40%

Protector – 30%

TotalDrama – 20%

Area – 10%

Input
You receive from the console:

Budget - real number in the range [10.0… 100.0]

Count series - n – whole number in the range [1… 10]

For each series you receive two lines:

Name of the series - string

Price for a series - real number in the range [1.0… 15.0]

Output
Print one line on the console:

If your budget is greater than or equal to the price of the series: "You bought all the series and left with {money left}$"

If your budget is less than the price of the series: "You need {money needed}$ more to buy the series!"

The result must be formatted to two digits after the decimal point.
