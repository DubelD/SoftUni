Charity event

Description
At a charity event, payments for the purchased products are always alternated: cash payment and card payment. Always first payment method is cash.

The following payment rules have been established:

If the product exceeds 100 dollars, it cannot be paid in cash

If the product is priced under 10 dollars, it cannot be paid by credit card

The program ends either after we receive the command "End", or after the funds are collected.

Input
Read from the console:

The amount expected to be collected from sales - integer in range [1...10000]

On each subsequent line, until the "End" command is received or until the necessary funds are collected:
- The prices of items to be purchased - integer in range [1...500]

Output
Print on the console:

In case of successful transaction: "Product sold!"

In case of unsuccessful transaction: "Error in transaction!"

If the sum of all purchased products exceeds or reaches the expected amount, the program must be completed and two lines are printed to the console:

"Average CS: {average payment in person's cash}"

"Average CC: {average card payment per person}"
Payments must be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.

When the "End" command is received, one line is written:

"Failed to collect required money for charity."
