Your task is to write a program that calculates the amount that should be paid.

Entrance fee must be paid for every single person.

You should keep in mind that an umbrella is enough for two people. It is known that only 75% of the team wants sunbeds.

In the calculation of the number of umbrellas and sunbeds, their number should be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

First line - number of people - whole number in the range [1... 100]

Second line - entrance fee - real number in the range [0.00... 50.00]

Third line - price for a sunbed - real number in the range [0.00... 50.00]

Fourth line - price for one umbrella - real number in the range [0.00... 50.00]
