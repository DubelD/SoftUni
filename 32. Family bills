Family bills

Description
Write a program to calculate the average cost per month for a family over a period of time. For each month the costs are as follows:

For electricity - every month the bill is different and will be read from the console

For water - 20$

For Internet - 15$

For others - sum the bills for electricity, water and Internet and add 20%

For each bill, you need to calculate how much total is paid for all months.

Input
The input is read from the console:

The months for which the average cost is searched – integer in range [1... 100]

For each month – the bill for electricity – a real number in range [1.00... 1000.00]

Output
Print to the console 5 rows:

"Electricity: {electricity for all months} $"

"Water: {water for all months} $"

"Internet: {Internet for all months} $"

"Other: {Other for all months} $"

"Average: {Average all costs per month} $ "

All bills should be formatted to the 2nd digit after the decimal point.
