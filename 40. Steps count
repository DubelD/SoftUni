Steps count

Description
Gaby wants to start healthy life and she sets a goal to walk 10000 steps a day.

Write a program that reads from the console how many steps Gaby walks every time she is out and when she reaches the set goal, print a message:

"Goal reached! Good job!".

In case she wants to go home before reaching the goal, she will enter "Going home" command and the steps she had walked while she was going home.

After that, if she didn't manage to reach her goal, you have to print the following massage on the console:

"{difference in steps} more steps to reach goal."
"""

line = input()
steps = 0
steps_count = 0

while line != "Going home":
    steps = int(line)
    steps_count += steps
    if steps_count >= 10000:
        print("Goal reached! Good job!")
        break
    else:
        line = input()

if steps_count < 10000:
    home_steps = int(input())
    steps_count += home_steps
    if steps_count < 10000:
        print(f'{10000 - steps_count} more steps to reach goal.')
    else:
        print("Goal reached! Good job!")
