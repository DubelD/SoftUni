Legacy

Description
Josh is 18 years old and receives a legacy that consists of X amount of money and time machine.

He decided to return until 1800, but he did not know if the money would suffice to live without working.

Write a program that calculates whether Josh will have enough money to not have to work until a certain year.

Assuming that for every even (1800, 1802, etc.) year will spend 12 000 dollars.

For each odd (1801, 1803, etc.) will spend 12 000 + 50 * [the years age in a given year].

Input
The input is read from the console and contains exactly 2 lines:

Legacy money – real number in range [1.00... 1,000,000.00]

Year to be lived (inclusive) – integer in range [1801... 1900]

Output
Print on the console a single line. The amount must be formatted to two decimal digits:

If the money are enough:

"Yes! He will live a carefree life and will have {N} dollars left." – where N are the money that will remain

If the money are NOT enough:

"He will need {М} dollars to survive." - where M are money he needs
