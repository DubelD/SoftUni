Description
Write a program that calculates the average grade of a student from his entire education.

Input
On the first line you will receive the name of the student, and on each following line his annual grades. - The student passes to upper class, if his annual grade is 4.00 or greater.

If his grade is less than 4.00, he has to repeat the class.

Output
If the student graduates 12th class, you have to print:

"{student name} graduated. Average grade: {average grade from his entire education}"

The grade should be formatted to the second decimal point.
