Pets

Description
Write a program calculating the amount of kilograms food Martina's pets will eat for the time she is on adventure and checks if the food is enough.

Each animal eats certain amount food per day.

Input
Read five lines from the console:

number of days - an integer in range [1…5000]

left food in kilograms - an integer in range [0…100000]

food for the dog per day in kilograms - floating-point number in range [0.00…100.00]

food for the cat per day in kilograms - floating-point number in range [0.00…100.00]

food for the turtle per day in grams - floating-point number in range [0.00…10000.00]

Output
Print on the console a single line:

If the left food IS enough:

"{kilograms remain} kilos of food left." The result should be rounded to the nearest lower integer

If the left food IS NOT enough:

"{kilograms needed} more kilos of food are needed.". The result should be rounded to the nearest higher integer
