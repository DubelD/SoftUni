Harvest

Description
40 % of the wine-making crop is allocated from a vineyard of X square meters.

From 1 square meter vineyard are earn Y kilos of grapes.

For 1 liter of wine are needed 2.5 kg grapes.

The desired amount of wine for sale is Z liters.

Write a program that calculates how much wine can be produced and whether this quantity is enough.

If sufficient, the remainder is divided equally between the workers of the vineyard.

Input
The entrance is read from the console and consists of exactly 4 rows:

X sq. m is the vineyard - integer in range [10 … 5000]

Y grapes for one sq. m - floating-point number in range [0.00 … 10.00]

Z need liters of wine - integer in range [10 … 600]

Number of workers - integer in range [1 … 20]

Output
The following should be printed on the console:

If the wine produced is less than necessary:

"It will be a tough winter! More {unattainable wine} liters wine needed."

The result must be rounded to a lower integer

If the wine produced is more than or equal to necessary:

"Good harvest this year! Total wine: {Total wine} liters."

The result must be rounded to a lower integer

"{remaining wine} liters left -> {wine for 1 worker} liters per person."

Both results must be rounded to the higher integer
