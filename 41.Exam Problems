Exam Problems

Description
Write a program in which Martin solves problems for exams until he receives message from his trainer: "Enough".

Every time he solves a problem, he get a grade. The program should ends either Martin receives "Enough" command, or obtain the number of poor grades.

A poor grade is a grade less or equal to 4.00.

Input
On the first line – number of poor grades – integer in range [1…5]

After that repeatedly two lines:

Name of a problem - text

Grade - integer in range [2…6]

Output
If Martin reaches "Enough" command, print 3 lines:

"Average score: {average grade}"

"Number of problems: {number of ALL problems}"

"Last problem: {last problem's name}"

If he gets the specified number of poor grades:

"You need a break, {number poor grades} poor grades."

The average grade should be formatted to the second decimal point.
