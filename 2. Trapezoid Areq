Trapezoid Areq

Description
Write a program that calculates the area of trapezoid with bases b1 and b2 and height h.

The formula for calculating area of a trapezoid is ((b1 + b2) / 2) * h.

Input
Read three numbers from the console:

bases - b1 and b2 - real numbers in range [1...1000]

height - h - real number in range [1...1000]

Output
Print on the console a single number - the area of the trapezoid, formatted to the second decimal point.
"""

b1 = float(input())
b2 = float(input())
h = float(input())
area = ((b1 + b2) / 2) * h
print(f'{area:.2f}')
