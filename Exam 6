Exam 6

Description
For Laura, the words possess great power.

She's asking you to invent an algorithm to find out which is the "strongest" word.

Until the command "End of words" you will be receiving words from the console.

To determine the strength of each word, you need to find the sum of the ASCII values of the symbols that make up the word.

If it starts with a vowel letter - 'a', 'e', ' i', 'o', 'u', 'y'(or their equivalent capital letters), the result must be multiplied by the length of the word, otherwise, divided by the length and rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Input
Until the command "End of words" you will receive lines from the console:

word â€“ string

Output
Print the word with the "greatest" power:

"The most powerful word is {word with the "greatest" power} - {word's power}"
