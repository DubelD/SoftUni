Exam 4

Description
The weather is warming up and the clubs are launching promising offers.

Write a program that calculates the profit of a club for the evening and whether the desired profit is reached, keeping in mind the following:

The price of a cocktail is its name's length.

If the price of an order is an odd number, there is a 25% discount on the order price.

Input
You will receive:

On the first line – the desired profit of the club - real number in the range [1.00... 15000.00]

A series of two rows until the command "Party!" or until the desired profit is reached:

Name of the cocktail - string

Number of cocktails for the order - whole number in the range [1… 50]

Output
First, print one line on the console:

If you receive the command "Party!":

"We need {money needed} dollars more."

If the desired profit is reached:

"Target acquired."

Then print:

"Club income - {club's profit} dollars."

The money must be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.
