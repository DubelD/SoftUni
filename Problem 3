Problem 3

Description
For the upcoming premiere of three popular productions a local cinema has hired you to write a software that calculates the price, which the clients have to pay, depending on the movie and the offer they have chosen.

John Wick

Star Wars

Jumanji

Drink

12$

18$

9$

Popcorn

15$

25$

11$

Menu

19$

30$

14$

Write a program that calculates the price that has to be paid.

Keep in mind that there are discounts:

If the chosen movie is "Star Wars" and at least four tickets are bought, there is 30% family discount.

If the chosen movie is "Jumanji" and the tickets bought are exactly two, there is 15% discount for two.

Input
You receive 3 lines from the console:

First line - movie - string: "John Wick", "Star Wars" or "Jumanji"

Second line - offer - string:"Drink", "Popcorn" or "Menu"

Third line - count tickets – whole number in the range [1… 30]

Output
Print one line on the console: "Your bill is {total price}$"

The price must be formatted to two digits after the decimal point.
